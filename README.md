Device-friendly implementation of the Gaussian Elimination algorithm to speed up the homography estimation step in a hypothesize-and-verify scheme.

This is a stand-alone (SSE and NEON disabled) version of the
"New back-end algorithm for Homography estimation under RHO flag" merged to OpenCV 3.0 under BSD license.

The Winning algorithm for OpenCV Vision Challenge 2015, sponsored by Intel.
